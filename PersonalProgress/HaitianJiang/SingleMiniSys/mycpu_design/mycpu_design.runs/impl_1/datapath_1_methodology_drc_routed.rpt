2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_blk_mem_gen_0/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/CLKARDCLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_data_ram/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/CLKARDCLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock u_cpu_clk/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin u_cpu_clk/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, u_cpu_clk/clk_in1, u_blk_mem_gen_0/clka, u_data_ram/clka
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[28] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[28]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[29] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[29]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[30] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[30]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[31] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_pc_1/pc_plus_4_reg[31]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
